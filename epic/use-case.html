		<p>Preconditional: Capri is logged in to TvTropes.</p>
		<p>Postconditional: A relevant article has been updated with new information.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Capri opens up the TvTropes homepage in her web browser.</li>
			<li>Capri clicks on the link to the "Tropes" index. The index pops up.</li>
			<li>Capri navigates through several layers of indexes to the page "Retroactive Preparation"... eventually. (She opens up three other pages in seperate tabs along the way.)</li>
			<li>As Capri is logged in, the "Edit Page" button is visible at the top of the page. She clicks it and is brought to another page on which she can edit the main page's contents.</li>
			<li>Using the text field, she enters in an example of Retroactive Preparation shown in the episode she watched. Then she hits the "Save Page" button.</li>
			<li>She is navigated automatically to the main "Retroactive Preparation" page, which has been altered with her edits.</li>
